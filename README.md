# Psys Exercise

PSYS Exercise is a collection of Python scripts created by Tony Schneider to practice solving problems in the field of psychoacoustics. The scripts cover a range of topics, including sound localization, signal processing, and auditory perception.

Each script is designed to be run independently and includes a set of exercises that challenge the user to apply their knowledge of psychoacoustics to solve a specific problem. The scripts are written in Python and utilize various Python libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib.

The repository includes instructions for installation and usage, as well as sample datasets and solutions to the exercises. Users are encouraged to modify the scripts and datasets to create their own exercises and problems to solve.
